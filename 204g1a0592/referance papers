<h3>Chatbots: An overview. Types, Architecture, Tools and Future Possibilities</h3>

<h4><p>
  This paper explains about the different types of architecture and available framesworks to develop a chatbot.
  Different type of chatbots are:
  Knowledge domain
  Service Provided
  Goal
  Response generation method
  <h5>Knowledge domain</h5> In Knowledge domain we have (based on the  amount of data they are trained upon)
      Open Domain: about general topics and respond appropriately. Not restricted to a single purpose.    
      Closed Domain:  focused on a particular knowledge domain and might fail to respond to other questions. Our chatbot is closed domain.
  <h5>Service Provided:</h5>Amount of intimate interaction that takes place and hence is also dependent upon the task the bot is performing.
      InterPersonal
      InteraPersonal
      Inter-agent
  <h5>Goals:</h5>Here the bots are classified based on the primary goal they aim to achieve.
      Informative
      Chatbased/conversational
      Task Based
      Input processing and response generation model i.e Hybrid
 It also explained about the architecture. What are the steps and order to develop a chatbot
 A chatbot consists of four stages sequential ,the input is taken and processed into appropriate format. second, named entities are extracted and intent 
 is discovered. These are used to generate possible responses is generated or multiple responses are generated or selected and finally the most appropriate 
 response is presented to the user.
 Chunking, Sentence Boundary Detection, Sentence Parsing, Part of Speech Tagging are some of the basic input processing algorithms.
 The papers explained about the future possiblities in chatbot and challenges in it.
 The future possibilities include:Context Awareness, Intentions driven respones, Narration and continoues of respone are some possiblities.
 The about key points helped to classify the type the chatbot we need to implement.
