<h2>Attributies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b><u>SEC (Socioeconomic Class): </u></b></li>socioeconomic status of the mother, which can impact childbirth in several ways. Mothers from lower socioeconomic classes may have limited access to healthcare, nutrition, and prenatal care, which can increase the risk of complications and low birth weight.
  <li><b><u>Age (in years):</u></b></li>The mother's age can play a role in childbirth. Teenage mothers (preetrem birth , anemia , iron defiency and blood pressure) and older mothers (35 and older) are at higher risk of complications, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and placenta-related issues,including LBW, compared to women in their twenties.
  <li><b><u> Bgroup (Blood Group):</li></u></b>Blood group compatibility between the mother and baby can be important in cases of Rh incompatibility.
    <li><b><u>Parity</li></u></b>Parity refers to the number of pregnancies a woman has had. 
    <li><b><u>ANCIwt (Antenatal Care Initial Weight)</li></u></b> Monitoring a mother's weight during prenatal care 
      <li><u><b>FWt (Final Weight)</b></u></li>weiht of mother at present check up
  <li><b><u>IBP_sys and IBP_dias (Initial Blood Pressure Systolic and Diastolic)</li> High blood pressure (hypertension) during pregnancy, known as preeclampsia, can contribute to LBW by reducing blood flow to the placenta, affecting fetal growth.
    <li><b><u>FBP_sys and FBP_dias (Final Blood Pressure Systolic and Diastolic)</li>Persistently high blood pressure throughout pregnancy can increase the risk of LBW and other complications.
      <li><b><u>IHb (Initial Hemoglobin)</li></u></b>hemoglobin at initial stage of pregency
        <li><b><u> FHb (Final Hemoglobin)</li></u></b>Hemoglobin level at time of check up
        <li><b><u>Blood Sugar (BS)</u></b></li> Blood sugar, or blood glucose, refers to the concentration of sugar (glucose) present in the bloodstream at any given time, which impact of delivering a baby with a high birth weight (macrosomia) rather than a low birth weight.
        <li><u><b>RBS (Random Blood Sugar)</u></b></li> It refers to the measurement of blood glucose at any random time during the day, regardless of fasting.
        <li><u><b></u>Sex</li></b></u>The sex of the baby can impact birth weight, with male infants typically being slightly heavier than female infants on average.
        <li><u><b>LNH (Low Nutritional History)</u></b></li> poor nutrition during pregnancy, which can significantly impact fetal growth and contribute to LBW.
