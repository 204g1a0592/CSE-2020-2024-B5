<h2>Attributies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b><u><h3>SEC (Socioeconomic Class):</h3> </u></b></li>socioeconomic status of the mother, which can impact childbirth in several ways. Mothers from lower socioeconomic classes may have limited access to healthcare, nutrition, and prenatal care, which can increase the risk of complications and low birth weight.
  <li><b><u><h3>Age (in years):</h3></u></b></li>The mother's age can play a role in childbirth. Teenage mothers (preetrem birth , anemia , iron defiency and blood pressure) and older mothers (35 and older) are at higher risk of complications, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and placenta-related issues,including LBW, compared to women in their twenties.
  <li><b><u> <h3>Bgroup (Blood Group):</h3></li></u></b>Blood group compatibility between the mother and baby can be important in cases of Rh incompatibility.
    <li><b><u><h3>Parity:</h3></li></u></b>Parity refers to the number of pregnancies a woman has had. 
    <li><b><u><h3>ANCIwt (Antenatal Care Initial Weight):</h3></li></u></b> Monitoring a mother's weight during prenatal care 
      <li><u><b><h3>FWt (Final Weight):</h3></b></u></li>weiht of mother at present check up
  <li><h3>Term/Preterm:</h3></li>Any previous develivery is pretrem. Refers to the gestational age at which the baby is born. Babies born before 37 weeks of gestation are considered preterm, and they are at a higher risk of LBW because they haven't had enough time to grow in the womb.
  <li><b><u><h3>IBP_sys:</h3>High initial blood pressure systolic (IBP_sys) during pregnancy may increase the risk of low birth weight (LBW) due to its potential association with reduced blood flow to the placenta, impacting fetal growth. Proper monitoring and management are essential to mitigate this risk.</u></b></li>
 <li><h3> Height (cm):</h3></li> Maternal height can affect childbirth as shorter stature might be associated with a smaller pelvis, potentially leading to difficulties during labor and delivery.
   <li><h3> IBP_dias (Initial Blood Pressur Diastolic)</h3></li> High blood pressure (hypertension) during pregnancy, known as preeclampsia, can contribute to LBW by reducing blood flow to the placenta, affecting fetal growth.
    <li><b><u><h3>HBP_sys  (Final Blood Pressure Systolic):</h3></u></b></li>The final blood pressure systolic (FBP_sys) of a pregnant woman is generally not directly associated with low birth weight (LBW) in the baby. Instead, factors such as maternal health, prenatal care, and overall well-being play a more significant role in influencing fetal growth and birth weight.
      <li><h3>FBP_dias (Final Blood Pressure Diastolic):</h3></li>Persistently high blood pressure throughout pregnancy can increase the risk of LBW and other complications.
      <li><b><u>IHb (Initial Hemoglobin)</li></u></b>hemoglobin at initial stage of pregency
        <li><b><u><h3> FHb (Final Hemoglobin):</h3></li></u></b>Hemoglobin level at time of check up
        <li><b><u><h3>Blood Sugar (BS):</h3></u></b></li> Blood sugar, or blood glucose, refers to the concentration of sugar (glucose) present in the bloodstream at any given time, which impact of delivering a baby with a high birth weight (macrosomia) rather than a low birth weight.
        <li><u><b><h3>RBS (Random Blood Sugar):</h3></u></b></li> It refers to the measurement of blood glucose at any random time during the day, regardless of fasting.
        <li><u><b></u><h3>Sex:</h3></li></b></u>The sex of the baby can impact birth weight, with male infants typically being slightly heavier than female infants on average.
        <li><u><b><h3>LNH (Low Nutritional History)</h3></u></b></li> poor nutrition during pregnancy, which can significantly impact fetal growth and contribute to LBW.
